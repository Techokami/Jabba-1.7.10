TODO/Ideas:
- New dolly to clone barrel with upgrades(maybe inventory also?), admin only, no recipe(shift right click to add clone, regular right click makes copies of stored item).
  As this will be a clone dolly, was thinking of making it also have an easter egg of when shift right clicking on empty ground with no stored item it could spawn a sheep named "Dolly"
- Creative core, costs 120 slots. when applied the barrel will no longer decrement stored item count when pulled from(by hand or automated)
    Not craftable, or go crazy and require a nether star? =D  nah... just not craftable and op/admin only.

Done:
- Added a creative tab for JABBA; it has more items on it than some vanilla tabs
- Moved the core upgrade code out of the tile entity, that class was getting a little unwieldy to work with...
- Did some work to further modularize the core upgrades, also added descriptions to core upgrade item tooltips
- changed TE save version to 4, UpgradeCore.NONE isn't needed anymore so the values shifted down by one
- Used new core upgrade functionality to add x3, x9, x27 size storage upgrades
- Finished localizing the remaining strings, I think.  This affects items tooltips and WAILA mostly
- Added a Void core upgrade, costs 2 slots. When installed, any excess incoming items over the barrels storage capacity are deleted.
    Tested with double right clicking to empty inventory
    Automation tested with Barrel Hopping upgrades, Vanilla Hoppers, and BC pipes
- Added Void Hammer to work with the new upgrade type 
- Recipes for the new core upgrades:
    For storage they are shapeless 3 of the previous tier, reversible
    For void core it is two pistons and obsidian
- Changed the double right click method to use getTotalWorldTime instead of getWorldTime.  This allows for it to function on servers where the gamerule doDaylightCycle is false
